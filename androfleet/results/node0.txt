  Scenario: 1- Simple image sharing - Receiving              # features/node0.feature:3
    Given I activate WiFi Direct                             # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:26
    Then I wait up to 60 seconds for "Available" to appear   # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/progress_steps.rb:26
    Then I don't see the text "Disconnect"                   # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/assert_steps.rb:23
    Then I wait for 5 seconds                                # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/progress_steps.rb:10
    Then I press the menu key                                # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/navigation_steps.rb:5
    Then I press the text view "Discover"                    # features/step_definitions/calabash_steps.rb:13
    Then I should see "finding peers"                        # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/assert_steps.rb:9
    Then I wait up to 60 seconds for "CHOOSE FILE" to appear # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/progress_steps.rb:26
    Then I wait for 60 seconds                               # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/progress_steps.rb:10
    Then I take a screenshot                                 # calabash-android-0.9.0/lib/calabash-android/steps/screenshot_steps.rb:9
